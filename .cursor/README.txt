Cursor Rules Starter Pack — Angular (v20-ready)

Place the `rules` directory at the root of your Angular workspace.
Cursor will automatically consume files in `.cursor/rules/*.md` as project rules.

Tips:
- Keep rules short, imperative, and technology-specific.
- Prefer multiple small rule files over one large file.
- Update versions when your Angular major/minor changes.
